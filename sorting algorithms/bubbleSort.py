# Bubble sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
# After each pass, the largest element "bubbles up" to the end of the list.
# Repeat until no swaps are needed.
# time complexity - O(n**2)
# space - complexity - O(1)
# stable sort (two equal elements in the sorted array are at the same order as they were in input array) - yes
# inplace sort (doesnâ€™t require extra memory proportional to input size) - yes
